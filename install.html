		<p>Install instructions</p>
    <ol>
      <li>COPY the folder "The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection" 
to the desired install location (program files).</li>
<li>Inside the subfolder "__Installer," Right-click on the file "Touchup.exe" and create a shortcut. It is possible that you may get an error message that the shortcut "cannot be created in this location." If so, send it to the desktop.</li>
<li>Right-click on the shortcut and select "Properties," then at the end of the "Target" line, paste the following without brackets, including the space at the beginning: [ install -locale en_US -installPath "C:\Program files\The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection" -autologging]. When you're done, the line will say ""C:\Program Files\The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection\__Installer\Touchup.exe" install -locale en_US -installPath "C:\Program files\The Sims 2 Ultimate Collection" -autologging".</li>
<li>Double-click on the "Touchup.exe - Shortcut", and ... wait for about 10 seconds. Touchup.exe will install the game silently in the background with the paramaters that were entered into the Target.</li>
<li>Copy the Sims2EP9.exe from the CRACK folder to Fun With Pets/SP9/TSBin and overwrite the original file.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the game is installed, move on to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTDyBzrZkJrZ1uFouUZ-UCB0zfJGUlg0J-hRPkvPVlYeC--6RdmWL4el_fGWm_gJWrTFmKC4cJgmOOl/pub#h.36h6mmijxxwm">Guide</a> for modern systems.
<p>Further troubleshooting can be found in the installation guide that comes with the torrent.</p>
<p>DO NOT use the Graphics Rules Maker that comes with the torrent, it is old and doesn't have the new fixes needed to run the game.</p>
